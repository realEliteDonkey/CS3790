SIMPLETRON V2

- memory consists of 10000 words, broken into 100 pages,
  each holding 100 words.
- each word can hold a signed 6 digit decimal number
- each instruction occupies 1 word of memory
- each location in memory can contain an instruction, data value, or 
  undefined program.
- first 2 digits == OP code of instruction.
- last 4 digits == operand of instruction.
- valid numerical range: 6 digits (-999999 <-> 999999)

- 4 registers: accumulator, instruction counter, 
  instruction register, index register.
- Accumulator: used to store and test values.
- Instruction Counter: holds address of next instruction to execute.
- Instruction Register: contains instruction itself.
- Index Register: useful for stepping through strings and arrays, also
  holding loop iterations and counters.
